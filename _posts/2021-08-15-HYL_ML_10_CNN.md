# CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks

When using fully connected networks on images, the number of parameters may be too large. By applying constraints on the networks based on properties of images, we can reduce the total number of parameters.

The fundamental concept of CNN is "to let filters convolve through the image".

## Input Images

We have to transform the input image to the size of the input of the network in advance.

The color images have 3 channels (RGB) on every pixel; the black-white have only 1 channel.

## Properties of Images

When using the CNN techniques, make sure that your task meet the corresponding properties. e.g. AlphaGo don;t use pooling, NLP/Speech recognition only convolve through a single dimension.

### Critical Patterns in Small Areas: Receptive Field

### Critical Patterns at Different Regions: Weight Sharing

### Subsampling Don't Impact the Recognition: Pooling
