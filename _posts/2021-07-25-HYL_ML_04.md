## What are Classification Problems

Input features & output the class that the input should belong to.

## The effectiveness of Solving Classification as Regression

If we use value 1, 2, 3, 4 ... as the outputs of classes, there may be problems. 1st, there may be penalty to the examples that are "too correct". For example:

2nd, such approach implicitly assumes that the neighboring classes (e.g. 1 & 2, 5 & 6) are quantitative closer than other classes, which is false by the meaning of "classes".
