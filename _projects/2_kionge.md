### Chap3: Bike-Share Predictor

#### Follow the book's approach

#### Try to train on unnormalized target data

In the previous practice in this chaper to make a failed predictor, I found that using unnormalized y data lead to better fitting result. Therefore, I want to try using unnormalized y data on the share-bike predictor here.

The notebooks here follows the the notebooks of "follow the book's approach".

[data preprocessing & train/test part1](https://github.com/baliuzeger/kiong-e-PyTorch/blob/master/capital_bike_share/exhibit-nb/ch3-predictor-unnormalized1.ipynb), [train/test part2 & analysis on the model](https://github.com/baliuzeger/kiong-e-PyTorch/blob/master/capital_bike_share/exhibit-nb/ch3-predictor-unnormalized2.ipynb).

The main result is that the predictions generated by the model became discrete, and I found that only a few neurons of the hidden layer can be active and others are mostly idle.
