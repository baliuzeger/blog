## Overview of Reinforcement Learning

### Scenarios

We are training *agents*. The agents have *observations* to the *environment* and then take *actions*. the action change the environments, and then the environments give the agents *rewards*. The agents are then udpated based on the rewards.

![RL scenario](https://baliuzeger.github.io/sjl/assets/images/HYL_ML_23_RL/scenario.png)

In old days, the models are weaker, so people process the observations into *states* before feed them to the model. Now the 2 terms *observation* and *state* are exchangable.

### Comparing Reinforcement Learning & Supervised Learning

A key difference between supervised learning (classification or regression) and reinfrocement learning: in reinforcement learning, the machines' decision at the current step effect the data (i.e. the environment) of the later steps. In supervised learning, the data is independent from the machines' current decision.

When we want machines to learn complex behaviors, a problem of behavior cloning, i.e. supervised learning, is that the examples provided by human may include useless movements. By behavior cloning, the machines mimic all the behaviors and cannot recognize which movements are important and which are useless. In the worst cases, the machines may learn only the useless parts and we get poor results. Reinforcement learning can avoid such problem.

Also, in some cases, even we don't know what are the correct behaviors and cannot provide examples to the machines. Reinforcement learning is suitable for such kind of tasks.

### Learning by Demonstration

Also *imitation learning* or *apprenticeship learning*. An expert demonstrate hot to solve the task, and the machine learns from the demonstration. Not behavior cloning! Inverse reinforcement learning is an example.
