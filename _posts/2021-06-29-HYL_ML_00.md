## Definitions & Relationships of Terminologies
**Artificial intelligence**: The overall goal of the research, i.e. to let machines be as intelligent as human.
**Machine Learning**: An approach to AI, i.e. to let machines learn.

**Deep Learning**: Another approach to AI by ANN of more then 3 layers.

My comments: The definitions actually varies by context.

## The 3 Steps of Machine Learning, Simplified
 1. Define a set of functions.
 2. Define goodness of functions.
 3. Pick the best function.

#1 is "choose a ML model", #2 can be "define a loss function", #3 is "training".
