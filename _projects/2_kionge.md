### Chap3: Bike-Share Predictor
[Follow the book's approach](https://baliuzeger.github.io/sjl/blog/2022/kionge_3_sharebike_follow)

[Try to train on unnormalized target data](https://baliuzeger.github.io/sjl/blog/2022/kionge_3_sharebike_unnormalized)

In the previous practice in this chaper to make a failed predictor, I found that using unnormalized y data lead to better fitting result. Therefore, I want to try using unnormalized y data on the share-bike predictor here.
